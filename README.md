# OmnikTCPReceiver
Receive messages from Omnik inverter with Node.JS and show the daily production in a Google Chart

Receiver.js is running on my Synology NAS. I have added the nas as a remote server on my inverter (omnik2000tl). The index.html file uses Google Charts to display the production of the day.
